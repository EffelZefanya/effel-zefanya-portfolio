            I'm Effel, a passionate aspiring software engineer with a strong interest
            in building modern web applications. I enjoy working with Java to craft clean back-ends.
            Currently, I'm learning about Java Spring Boot for REST API implementations and a little
            bit of Next.js. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer while contributing to impactful
            projects.
